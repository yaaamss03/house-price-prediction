# house-price-prediction
This is my first end-to-end ML model which predicts house price when you specify your features.
My ML flow:
(i.) Loading and Exploring the dataset
(ii.) EDA - Visualizing target variable
(iii.) Data Preprocessing - Outlier Analysis, Winsorization, Log Transformation
(iv.) Feature Engineering - Feature removal, Feature Extraction
(v.) Encoding
(vi.) Hypothesis Testing
(vii.) Feature Scaling (Standard Scaling)
(viii.) Data Split (Train, Test)
(ix.) ML Modelling - Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet
(x.) Model Evaluation Metrics
(xi.) Cross-Validation method (K-Fold Cross Validation)
(xii.) Check our House price!
